            <h2>BÃ i 1: Once the girl name Lan (fictional character) Real</h2>
            <h4>HAVE WRITTEN IN 01/07/2023</h4>
            <img max-height="730px" max-width="1000px"  src="https://kenh14cdn.com/Images/Uploaded/Share/2012/02/23/120223hdguongsang01.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>This story is about a junior high school student named Lan. Lan is a small girl with a big heart and a love for learning. However, her life has not been easy. <br><br>
              Lan comes from a poor family, and paying the monthly tuition fees is not always easy for her family. Every month, Lan has to work after school to earn extra money. This often leads to her falling asleep while studying, feeling down, and bored. <br> <br>
              Furthermore, in her class, Lan is often teased by her friends because she doesn't have the same resources as them. They always bring beautiful bags, new outfits, while Lan only has old study materials. This creates a noticeable difference between her and her peers. Some students even mock Lan by calling her "the poor student". <br> <br>
              Despite the difficulties, Lan never gives up. She always tries her best to overcome every situation. She knows that education is the door to escape from a difficult life and provide herself with a brighter future. <br> <br>
              One day, when she looks at her academic results, Lan is surprised to have achieved a high score in a test. Her teacher calls out her name in front of the class and praises her for her effort and passion. This not only makes Lan proud, but also increases her self-belief. <br> <br>
              Gradually, the derogatory remarks from her friends seem to have no effect on Lan anymore. She understands that not everyone understands the difficulties she has been through, and most importantly, she knows that the most important thing is to keep trying and never give up. <br> <br>
              Thanks to her determination and passion, Lan overcomes her hardships and achieves success. She receives a full scholarship from a prestigious university, opening up opportunities for further education and a brighter future. <br> <br>
              The story of Lan reminds us that nothing can stop us if we have enough self-belief and never give up in the face of difficulties. No matter how life may be, with patience and passion, we can overcome any challenges and achieve success. <br> <br>

            <h2>Letter From The Children.</h2>
            <h4>HAVE WRITTEN IN 10/07/2023</h4>
            <img src="https://static.tuoitre.vn/tto/i/s626/2013/08/31/OTe8wyPH.jpg" max-height="730px" max-width="1000px" alt="">
            <p>
              Dear parents and teachers, <br><br>

              I would like to write this letter to address a concerning issue regarding the lack of parental involvement in their children's lives. In this case, I want to share with you about a wealthy male middle school student that I have encountered recently.<br><br>
              
              This student, whom I will refer to as Minh, is undoubtedly a smart, talented, and highly potential young boy. However, it is unfortunate to see that his talents and potential are going to waste due to the lack of parental attention. Minh is excessively drawn to the allure of luxury and "the cool kids" - the parties, extravagant lifestyles, and indulgences.<br><br>
              
              Minh has everything that an ordinary student can only dream of: money, high-end electronic devices, fancy cars, and social status. Yet, amidst the noise of his lavish life, Minh has lost sight of his academic goals and forgotten the essential values needed for personal development.<br><br>
              
              Minh's parents, with all their financial power, have allowed him to indulge and have neglected guiding their child towards proper time management and responsibility. This has resulted in Minh becoming a distracted student, entertaining himself with troublesome activities and engaging in various vices.<br><br>
              
              Dear parents and teachers, I write this letter not to criticize or judge, but to urge you to pay attention to your children and demonstrate genuine care in the right measure. Help them realize the value of education and focus on personal growth.<br><br>
              
              To parents, please dedicate time to create a positive learning environment at home by encouraging goal-setting, time management, and monitoring their academic progress. Instill in your children the importance of pursuing personal passions and encourage them to develop social skills and good character.<br><br>
              
              To teachers, find ways to create engaging and interesting lessons that help students recognize the value of learning and develop life skills. Build a reliable learning environment where students feel loved and cared for, regardless of their resources or backgrounds.<br><br>
              
              Let us all recognize that our children are the future of our nation, and it is our responsibility to support and guide them towards becoming good and successful citizens. Let us be trustworthy companions on their journey of development.<br><br>
              
              Sincerely,<br><br>
